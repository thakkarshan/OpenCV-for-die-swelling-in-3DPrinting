# OpenCV-for-die-swelling-in-3DPrinting
I used OpenCV to study the effect of extrusion speed on die swelling in 3D printing.

Report.pdf - This file contains the overview of the process as well as results. 
results.xlsx - This is the file that contains information about diamater of the extruded filament. 
Effect-of-Extrusion-speed-on-diameter.ipybn - This notebook was run on Google Colab to process images and obtain the results.
